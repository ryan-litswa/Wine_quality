# Wine_quality
 The following repository contains data about the content found in red wine, we are trying to build a model that predicts the quality of red wine given the features.
 The following models are for categorical data, we created an arbitray classification bin to make it easier for our models in prediction.
 Moroever, decision tree and random forest are overfitting.
 The best performing model is the KNeighborsClassfier with an accuracy score of 0.8983580922595777 , while worst performing model is Gaussian Naive Bayes with an accuracy score of 0.8358092259577795 .
 Feel free to critic and provide any assitance on how the models can be improved.
